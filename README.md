## Introduction
Do you remember when you were a kid and the internet went out? The only thing left to do was the Dinosaur jumping game on Chrome. Does that ring a bell? Does that feel nostalgic? It did for me. _That's why I recreated it._

## How to play
1. Make an empty folder.
2. Open it in VS Code (or any other text editor).
3. Clone the repository
```git
git clone https://github.com/Lazzzer00/Dinosaur-Game
```
4. Navigate to the cloned repository.
```node
cd Dinosaur-Game
```
6. Install the Live Server VS Code extension.
5. Open the **index.html** file in the browser by right clicking and then _'Open with Live Server'_ or _Alt+L Alt+O_.
